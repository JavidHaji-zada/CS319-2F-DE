  Our term project selection is Defender. Defender is a space game that have set on an unnamed planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. In original game Defender has only a survival mode with growing waves and five different kind of enemies to protect the Defender spaceship and astronauts. Every different kind of alien has different score for killing them and another way to score points is rescuing astronauts from the aliens.Of course, we add some new features to customers to choose our version of game. In defender there is no time concept, in our version the daytime will change while player scoring some points, you can see both day and night.  You can also choose different planets to play in case of you are bored with same environment. If you want to play with your friend you can play with or against him/her with two player mode. If you choose play against him/her, a split screen game shows up and the one survives longer wins but if you choose coop mode there will be two defender and you will defend the astronauts together. Also, there will be a story mode.
